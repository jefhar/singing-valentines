# Contributor Guidelines
## Whereas
In the current social environment, '-isms' are the rage, whether sexism, racism, or
agalmatoism. The only thing that matters here is the code you produce, not who you are.
Once code is entered in your IDE and saved, it doesn't matter if you're male, female,
or some other identification. It doesn't matter if you skin color is pink, brown,
red, yellow, green, or plaid and covered in scales. It doesn't matter if you are into
BDSM or have a diaper fetish, or is into consensual sex slave role-play.

No one really cares. Everyone has their own problems. The long odds say that you
aren't one of my problems, and I'm not one of your problems.
 
### Therefore
Contributors to this code base shall not blatantly make '-ist' comments in anything
that shall be part of this repository, including but not limited to comments,
code, issues and git commit message.

Should you find something that "triggers" you, your first task is to *privately*
talk to the offending party. Start a dialog. Figure out if it is just a case of
[Hanlon's razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor). Keep it out of the
sphere of influence of this project as much as possible.
   
If, however, you find something in yourself that needs correcting, feel free to
announce that you have fixed yourself. But don't expect any awards to catch up with
the 21st century. While the rest of us will be pleased for your personal growth, the
 key word is "personal."

### As Such

Every contributor shall, before becoming a contributor, shall take the following pledge:

> I pledge to treat everyone with respect, to conduct myself in a professional manner,
> to act free of prejudice, and to code the shit out of this project and follow the
> PSR-12 guidelines.

You just read it. Now raise your right hand and say it out loud.

### Additionally
Your personal life is different from your professional life. In this sphere of
influence, each contributor shall conduct his/her-self professionally. On your own
facebook or twitter feed, feel free to be an asshole, or a pervert, or fanatical Red
Sox fan, whatever floats your consensual boat.
 
However, once you connect to this repository from any external source,
including but not limited to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Parlier, TikTok, or a
personal web page, that external source becomes part of this repository's sphere of
influence. If you have '-ism' or '-ist' actions that can be tracked to this repository,
you may be excluded from further contributions to this repository, and are subject to
being ridiculed by the entire world for your backwards thinking.

### Collary
If you find out through some external source, that someone is an "-ist" or practices
"-ism," keep it to yourself. It's external to this project, keep it that way.


## Because
Your code runs the same regardless of your plumbing. The code runs the same depending
on the tint of your flesh. The topic of this repository is not political, social, or
economic change. Keep those topics where they belong.

Harbinger said, "Rudimentary creatures of flesh and blood," he didn't say
"Rudimentary male and or female and or other creatures of white or black or brown
flesh and red or green blood." If imaginary mechanical creatures who want to erase
the galaxy of all space-faring creatures doesn't care what your skin color is,
neither should the people who live on the same pebble floating through space as you.
We already have enough things to worry about.

### In Conclusion
If you don't like it, either don't contribute to this project, or fork the project and
make your own changes.

Seriously, fork off. Our time on this planet is limited, and shouldn't be taken up by
worrying about the fate of things and people that we can't change.
